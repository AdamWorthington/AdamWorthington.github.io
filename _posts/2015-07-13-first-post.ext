As my first post I wanted to set some expectations for myself regarding the direction I want to take this in. Summer is coming to a close which means that I need to refresh on the academic side of computer science. I plan on attempting to impliment 7 data structures in 7 days starting tomorrow. I'll have the source hosted on my github for those interested and updates here on my progress.
